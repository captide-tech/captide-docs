This guide will help you get started with Captide quickly, showing you how to set up both the REST API and the Document Auditing JavaScript SDK to embed corporate disclosure intelligence into your systems.

<Info>
  Before you begin, make sure you [request a Captide test API key](https://www.captide.ai/contact/api-request).
</Info>

## Using the REST API

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key in the header:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://rest-apidev.captide.co/api/v1/companies/list' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Example 1: Retrieve Company Information

Use the [/companies/list](/api-reference/endpoint/companies) endpoint when you want to search companies in Captide and retrieve their company `id` to use as parameter in other endpoints.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://rest-apidev.captide.co/api/v1/companies/list?limit=100&tickers=STO.AX' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Use the response to retrieve company information and use the id to retrieve company docs:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "77848abe-a215-41b7-8950-86e89ea1fadc",
    "name": "Santos",
    "tickers": ["STO.AX"],
    "countries": ["AU"],
    "filesWithSec": false
  }
]
```

### Example 2: Retrieve Company Documents

Use the [/documents/list](/api-reference/endpoint/documents) endpoint to search for company documents by applying filters such as `documentCategories`, `formTypes`, or by specifying a companyâ€™s `tickers` or `id`. This allows you to retrieve the metadata of the latest corporate disclosures of publicly listed companies.\
In the example below, we use the `id` of Santos to retrieve its latest `interim-reports`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://rest-apidev.captide.co/api/v1/documents/list?limit=100&companyIds=77848abe-a215-41b7-8950-86e89ea1fadc&documentCategories=interim-report' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

The response below contains metadata for each document. The document `id` is particularly important, as it is used to retrieve the document file and its formatted Markdown version.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "98381fbb-8d8c-4b47-b31c-819f8aca0690",
    "documentCategory": "interim-report",
    "formType": null,
    "tickers": [
      "STO.AX"
    ],
    "companyName": "Santos",
    "date": "2025-04-17",
    "fiscalQuarter": 1,
    "fiscalYear": 2025,
    "title": "First Quarter Report for period ending 31 March 2025",
    "description": "This document is the First Quarter Report of Santos Limited for the period ending 31 March 2025. It provides a detailed overview of the company's operational and financial performance, including production volumes, sales, revenue, capital expenditure, project updates, and guidance for 2025."
  },
  {
    "id": "095d866c-c6df-4799-bce3-61b60a5d62ea",
    "documentCategory": "interim-report",
    "formType": null,
    "tickers": [
      "STO.AX"
    ],
    "companyName": "Santos",
    "date": "2025-01-23",
    "fiscalQuarter": 4,
    "fiscalYear": 2024,
    "title": "Fourth Quarter Report for period ending 31 December 2024",
    "description": "This document is the Fourth Quarter Report of Santos Limited for the period ending 31 December 2024. It provides a detailed overview of the company's financial and operational performance, including sales revenue, production volumes, capital expenditure, project updates, and carbon capture and storage activities."
  },
  ...
]
```

Once target documents are identified, we can use their `id` with the [/documents/{id}](/api-reference/endpoint/get_document) endpoint to retrieve the URLs for the document files.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://rest-apidev.captide.co/api/v1/documents/98381fbb-8d8c-4b47-b31c-819f8aca0690 \
  --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```json
{
  "id": "98381fbb-8d8c-4b47-b31c-819f8aca0690",
  "documentCategory": "interim-report",
  "formType": null,
  "tickers": [
    "STO.AX"
  ],
  "companyName": "Santos",
  "date": "2025-04-17",
  "fiscalQuarter": 1,
  "fiscalYear": 2025,
  "title": "First Quarter Report for period ending 31 March 2025",
  "description": "This document is the First Quarter Report of Santos Limited for the period ending 31 March 2025. It provides a detailed overview of the company's operational and financial performance, including production volumes, sales, revenue, capital expenditure, project updates, and guidance for 2025.",
  "originalFileUrl": "https://files.captide.co/original-docs/77848abe-a215-41b7-8950-86e89ea1fadc/2025-Santos-First-Quarter-Report.pdf?se=2025-07-28T17%3A33%3A51Z&sp=r&sv=2025-07-05&sr=b&sig=B6JuHmW4Yoif5tMJItatav/Vwe9IzOoqSaHs%2BZEwbDk%3D",
  "markdownFileUrl": "https://files.captide.co/markdown-docs/77848abe-a215-41b7-8950-86e89ea1fadc/2025-Santos-First-Quarter-Report.md?se=2025-07-28T17%3A33%3A51Z&sp=r&sv=2025-07-05&sr=b&sig=umdy9HFMwQykzafdb62ZQAXF/4OXJHKM9Py0dfd2wuA%3D"
}
```

The response includes two additional fields: `originalFileUrl` and `markdownFileUrl`. These provide temporary access to the original document file and its formatted Markdown version, which is optimized for downstream analysis and LLM ingestion.

### Example 3: Prompt-Based Chunk Retrieval

With Captide, you can create RAG-based applications and tools without the need to collect, preprocess, chunk, or store document excerpts yourself. Simply use the [/rag/chunk-retrieval](/api-reference/endpoint/chunks) endpoint to send natural language requests, and you'll receive relevant document excerpts from our database containing all the information needed to fulfill your query.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://rest-apidev.captide.co/api/v1/rag/chunks?query=Provide%20the%20net%20dollar%20retention%20of%20ZScaler%20for%20the%20last%20two%20quarters' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: xF2GJxlYwbw48ByD43BppsiSL4lcRoMX'
```

The response includes a list of relevant document chunks from the Captide database, along with their associated metadata.

You can then use the relevant chunks as context for AI-generated responses, and even combine them with context from other sourcesâ€”such as internal data or structured databases.

### Example 4: AI Agent Response

Captide enables you to get answers to any question grounded in information from corporate disclosures with full traceability. This allows you to instantly extract insights and metrics from millions of financial filings, or to build multi-agent systems that accelerate and enhance investment research. Below is an example query submitted to Captideâ€™s AI agent.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://rest-apidev.captide.co/api/v1/rag/agent-response?query=Provide%20the%20net%20dollar%20retention%20of%20ZScaler%20for%20the%20last%20two%20quarters' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: xF2GJxlYwbw48ByD43BppsiSL4lcRoMX'
```

The response includes the final answer in the `content` field, along with source identifiers (formatted as `#abcd1234`) embedded within the text. These identifiers link to the `sourceMap`, allowing each part of the answer to be traced back to the original document excerpts used.

```json

The `sourceMap` can be integrated with [Captideâ€™s Document Auditing SDK](/integration/frontend) to render relevant content chunks in frontend applications, enabling accurate source auditing.

### Example 5: Streaming AI Agent Response

The [/rag/agent-response-stream](/api-reference/endpoint/agent_stream) endpoint streams Captideâ€™s AI agent responses in real time using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Itâ€™s useful in chat interfaces where you want to show the agentâ€™s reasoning steps and display the response as itâ€™s being generated, rather than waiting for the full message.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://rest-apidev.captide.co/api/v1/rag/agent-response?query=Provide%20the%20net%20dollar%20retention%20of%20ZScaler%20for%20the%20last%20two%20quarters' \

All `message/partial` events can be combined to reconstruct the full response and, as with the `/rag/agent-response` endpoint, the final `metadata` event can be used with [Captideâ€™s Document Auditing SDK](/integration/frontend) to display relevant content chunks in frontend applications, enabling accurate source traceability and auditing.

## Using the Document Auditing JavaScript SDK

### Installation

Install the Captide SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install captide
# or
yarn add captide
```

### Integration Example

Here's how to integrate the document viewer into your React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { DocumentViewer, DocumentViewerProvider, useDocumentViewer } from 'captide';

// Function to fetch document content from your backend that calls our API
const fetchDocument = async (sourceLink) => {
  const response = await fetch('/your-backend/document', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ source_link: sourceLink })
  });
  
  return response.json();
};

// Example component using the DocumentViewer
function App() {
  return (
    <DocumentViewerProvider fetchDocumentFn={fetchDocument}>
      <DocumentViewerDemo />
    </DocumentViewerProvider>
  );
}

function DocumentViewerDemo() {
  const { loadDocument } = useDocumentViewer();
  
  // IMPORTANT: sourceLink and elementId come from your API response
  // - sourceLink: The 'sourceLink' field from the id_mapping in the streaming response
  //   or the 'source_link' field in the chunks response
  // - elementId: The element ID reference (like '#a060daba') from either the streaming 
  //   or chunks response that you want to highlight
  const handleSourceLinkClick = async (sourceLink, elementId) => {
    // Load document and highlight specific element
    await loadDocument(sourceLink, elementId);
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button 
        onClick={() => handleSourceLinkClick(
          'https://rest-api.captide.co/api/v1/document?source_type=10-Q&document_id=69443120-e3a3-4ebb-91b1-a55ff2afe141',
          '#ab12ef34'
        )}
      >
        View Source
      </button>
      
      <div style={{ height: '600px', width: '100%', border: '1px solid #ccc' }}>
        <DocumentViewer />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
