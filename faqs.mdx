### Company Identification

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What defines a company in Captide?">
    We define a company as a publicly listed entity that files its financial results independently. In cases where a company files with multiple market regulators or is traded on multiple exchanges, we consider all such filings and listings to belong to the same entity in Captide—provided they refer to the same underlying corporation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which company identifiers does Captide use?">
    Captide assigns proprietary company identifiers (`companyId`) to uniquely identify each entity. Ticker symbols, when paired with their respective exchanges, also serve as reliable identifiers. Users can retrieve the full list of available companies—along with their `companyId` and `tickers` via the `/api/v1/companies/list` endpoint.
