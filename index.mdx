  This documentation is your guide to integrating Captide's APIs and leveraging our agentic AI systems for corporate disclosure analysis.
</Info>

Captide aggregates and processes **corporate disclosures from publicly listed companies around the world**, transforming them into formats optimized for AI applications. On top of this vast database of millions of global filings, Captide has developed agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that deliver auditable, highly accurate **AI workflows for financial document analysis**.

With Captide’s APIs, long/short hedge funds, investment banks, and software companies can **embed AI across their financial workflows**—extracting insights from millions of authoritative documents without the complexity of building or maintaining complex agentic RAG infrastructure.

Captide is designed to augment investment research, enable alternative data extraction, and facilitate feature discovery–while ensuring the **highest levels of confidence and auditability in every output**.

## Core Use Cases

- **Build multi-agent systems** able to analyze and reason from authorative company reports.

- Continuously monitor company disclosures to **detect material changes and surface early signals** of potential inflection points or shifts in outlook.
- **Screen companies** using changing disclosure signals to spot potential outliers or themes worth deeper analysis.
- **Extract and standardize hard-to-access data** to power investment models, enable faster benchmarking, and support investment thesis validation.
- Compare metrics, forward-looking guidance, risk language, and tone sentiment to **uncover divergences, outliers, or consensus shifts across custom peer sets.**
