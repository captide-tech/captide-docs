### Company Identification

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What defines a company in Captide?">
    We define a company as a publicly listed entity that files its financial results independently. In cases where a company files with multiple market regulators or is traded on multiple exchanges, we consider all such filings and listings to belong to the same entity in Captide—provided they refer to the same underlying corporation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which company identifiers does Captide use?">
    Captide assigns proprietary company identifiers (`companyId`) to uniquely identify each entity. Ticker symbols, when paired with their respective exchanges, also serve as reliable identifiers. Users can retrieve the full list of available companies—along with their `companyId` and `tickers` via the `/api/v1/companies/list` endpoint.

### Document Access

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When are new documents available?">
    New documents from US-listed companies are typically available within 5 minutes of release. For non-US-listed companies, documents are available within 24 hours. Earnings call transcripts are generally published 6 to 12 hours after the call concludes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are all document types available for every company?">
    Annual, interim, and current reports are available for all companies in Captide. Additional document types are provided for companies that have filed them at any point. Note that reporting practices vary by geography (for example, companies in the United States typically file quarterly interim reports, while those in Australia often file semi-annual reports). As a result, the availability and frequency of document types may vary by region, company, and regulatory requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do available document dates differ? Is point-in-time data available?">
    When retrieving documents, the following date-related parameters provide key information:

    - `documentDate`: Indicates the date the document refers to (e.g., the press release date for a current report, or the fiscal period end date for annual and interim reports).
    - `filingDate`: The date and time the document was made publicly available (useful for point-in-time analysis).
    - `fiscalYear` and `fiscalQuarter`: Indicate the fiscal period covered by the document.
    - `createdAt`: The date and time the document became available in Captide.
    - `updatedAt`: The most recent date and time the document was updated in Captide.
