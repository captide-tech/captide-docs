  This documentation is your guide to integrating Captide's APIs and leveraging our agentic AI systems for corporate disclosure analysis.
</Info>

Captide aggregates and processes **corporate disclosures from publicly listed companies around the world**, transforming them into formats optimized for AI applications. On top of this vast database of millions of global filings, Captide has developed agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that deliver auditable, highly accurate **AI workflows for financial document analysis**.

With Captide’s APIs, long/short hedge funds, investment banks, and software companies can **embed AI across their financial workflows**—extracting insights from millions of authoritative documents without the complexity of building or maintaining complex agentic RAG infrastructure.

Captide is designed to augment investment research, enable alternative data extraction, and facilitate feature discovery–while ensuring the **highest levels of confidence and auditability in every output**.
